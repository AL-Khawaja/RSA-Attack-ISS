# RSA (Keypair Generation, Encryption & Decryption)

## Description

This project is an implementation of the RSA algorithm, demonstrating its functionality and potential vulnerabilities. It includes a web interface for interaction with the RSA system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
- Python: The project is developed in Python. If you do not have Python installed, download and install it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or just download it from microsoft store by click on the following link [Microsoft store python 3.9](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9P7QFQMJRFP7?ocid=pdpshare). 

- Flask: This project uses Flask, a web framework for Python. After installing Python:
##### install Flask using pip:
>pip install Flask


## Installation

Clone the repository:
> git clone https://github.com/AL-Khawaja/RSA-Attack-ISS.git

Navigate to the project directory:

>cd RSA-Attack-ISS

## Usage
Start the application: 
>python main.py

The application will start on a local server. Open a web browser and navigate to 
>http://localhost:5000.

(Adjust the port number if your application uses a different one.)

Use the web interface provided in `index.html` to interact with the RSA algorithm
